# leafletMap

This leafletMap was made as a part of practical test for PT. Bhumi Varta Technology. Using Leaflet (open-sorce JavaScript Library), this code shows maps and markers in spesific point where each can be clicked and bind a pop up.

For creating this project i use _express_ as framework to build back ends/web application server, _EJS_ as templating engine, and _nodemon_ to monitor any changes in my source and restart my server.
